## Definitions and Synonyms at your Fingertips.

While reading [a_word_on_scalability](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html), I found myself confused at the word "heterogeneity". I guessed at its meaning and found out later that my guess was correct but I wanted a way to define it quickly.

This is where wordhelp comes in. With this python script, and accompanying windows executable(in releases), you can quickly learn what every word in your clipboard means. So Instead of using bloated google, and waiting for the gemini answer to load, you can copy whatever words you want and run wordhelp.exe.

It becomes very smooth and seamless if you put a shortcut on your desktop and set the shortcut to have a keybind(in Properties). In my case I set it to Ctrl + Alt + W.
